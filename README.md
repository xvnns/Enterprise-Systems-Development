# Book shop chain

In this work, I have developed a web application using the Spring framework. In addition, I used the following stack:
- Java 11
- Maven
- PostgreSQL
- Thymeleaf
- Liquibase
- Bootstrap

It is possible to log in and register in the application:

The application provides two levels of access: USER and ADMIN.

The user has the ability to add books to the shopping cart, edit the number of books in the cart and make a purchase:
